I have the script for transliteration of the calls
how can i connect it to openAI API to analyze the calls?

To connect your script for transliteration of the calls to the OpenAI API, you can follow these general steps:

Get an API key: To use the OpenAI API, you need to sign up for an API key. You can do this by visiting the OpenAI website and creating an account.

Install the OpenAI API package: You will need to install the OpenAI API package in your Python environment. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install openai

Set up your authentication credentials: To authenticate your requests to the OpenAI API, you need to set up your authentication credentials. You can do this by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to your API key:
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'

Use the OpenAI API in your script: Once you have set up your authentication credentials, you can use the OpenAI API in your script. You can use the openai.Completion class to generate responses to prompts. Here is an example of how you can use the API:
python
Copy code
import openai

# Set up the OpenAI API client
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

# Define your prompt
prompt = 'Transliterate the following call: "Hello, how are you?"'

# Set up the API parameters
parameters = {
    'model': 'text-davinci-002',
    'prompt': prompt,
    'temperature': 0.5,
    'max_tokens': 50,
    'n_stop': 1,
    'stop': '\n'
}

# Generate a response
response = openai.Completion.create(**parameters)

# Print the response
print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
In this example, the prompt variable contains the text you want to analyze, and the parameters variable contains the API parameters. The openai.Completion.create() method sends a request to the OpenAI API and returns a response containing the generated text.

tell me more about available parameters
Sure, here's an overview of some of the key parameters you can use when calling the OpenAI API:

model: The name of the language model to use for generating the response. OpenAI offers several models with varying capabilities and computational requirements. Some of the most commonly used models include text-davinci-002, davinci-codex, and curie.
prompt: The text prompt to use as the basis for generating the response. The prompt should be a string of text that provides context for the API to generate the desired output.
temperature: Controls the "creativity" or randomness of the response. A higher temperature value will result in more diverse and unpredictable responses, while a lower value will produce more conservative and predictable responses. A typical value for temperature is around 0.5.
max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens (words or punctuation marks) that the API should generate in the response. This parameter controls the length of the response and can be used to avoid excessively long or verbose output.
n_stop and stop: These parameters control the conditions under which the API should stop generating text. n_stop sets the number of responses to generate before stopping, while stop is a string of text that the API should stop generating text at. This can be useful for controlling the length or specificity of the response.
frequency_penalty and presence_penalty: These parameters control the degree to which the API should prioritize generating text that is original or similar to the prompt. A higher frequency_penalty will discourage the API from repeating the same phrases or patterns, while a higher presence_penalty will encourage the API to generate text that is similar to the prompt.
best_of: This parameter controls the number of responses to generate and return to the user. By default, the API generates a single response, but setting best_of to a higher number (e.g., 3 or 5) can improve the quality and diversity of the generated responses.
These are just a few of the parameters available when using the OpenAI API. You can find a full list of parameters and their descriptions in the OpenAI API documentation.

ok, can you put to the request the ability to ask the questions?
Yes, you can certainly use the OpenAI API to generate responses to questions. Here's an example of how you might modify the code I provided earlier to generate responses to questions:

python
Copy code
import openai

# Set up the OpenAI API client
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

# Define your prompt
prompt = 'Answer the following question: "What is the capital of France?"'

# Set up the API parameters
parameters = {
    'model': 'text-davinci-002',
    'prompt': prompt,
    'temperature': 0.5,
    'max_tokens': 50,
    'n_stop': 1,
    'stop': '\n'
}

# Generate a response
response = openai.Completion.create(**parameters)

# Print the response
print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
In this example, the prompt variable contains the question you want to answer, and the API will generate a response based on the context provided by the question. You can modify the prompt to ask any question you like.

It's worth noting that the quality of the response will depend on the quality of the question and the model you use. Some OpenAI models, such as GPT-3, are specifically designed to generate human-like responses to questions, while others may not be as well-suited to this task. You may need to experiment with different models and prompts to find the best approach for your needs.

in promt i need to ask 15 questions regarding the text witch will be given by the variable "call". the answers can be 'yes' 'no' and 'no need'.
how can i do it in the request?
Here's an example of how you could modify the code I provided earlier to ask 15 yes/no questions about the text in the call variable:

python
Copy code
import openai

# Set up the OpenAI API client
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

# Define the text you want to ask questions about
call = 'This is the text I want to analyze.'

# Define the questions you want to ask
questions = [
    'Does the text mention a person?',
    'Does the text mention a place?',
    'Is the text written in the past tense?',
    'Does the text contain a question?',
    'Is the text longer than 100 words?',
    'Is the text written in the first person?',
    'Does the text contain any numbers?',
    'Is the text written in the present tense?',
    'Does the text mention a time?',
    'Does the text contain any technical jargon?',
    'Does the text contain any humor?',
    'Does the text mention a brand?',
    'Is the text written in the third person?',
    'Does the text contain any references to popular culture?',
    'Is the text longer than 500 words?'
]

# Generate responses to each question
responses = []
for question in questions:
    prompt = f'{call}\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:'
    parameters = {
        'model': 'text-davinci-002',
        'prompt': prompt,
        'temperature': 0.5,
        'max_tokens': 10,
        'n_stop': 1,
        'stop': '\n'
    }
    response = openai.Completion.create(**parameters)
    answer = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    responses.append(answer)

# Print the responses to each question
for i, response in enumerate(responses):
    question = questions[i]
    print(f'{question} {response}')
In this example, the questions list contains 15 yes/no questions that you want to ask about the text in the call variable. For each question, the code generates a prompt that includes the question and the call variable, and then uses the OpenAI API to generate a response.

The responses are then stored in the responses list, and the code prints out each question and its corresponding response. The max_tokens parameter is set to 10, which should be sufficient for generating yes/no responses.

You can modify the questions list to ask any 15 yes/no questions you like. If you want to allow for the "no need" response, you could modify the prompts to include that option as well (e.g., "Answer: Yes, No, or No need").

how can i add the calls in a batch from csv file
Here's an example of how you could modify the code I provided earlier to read calls from a CSV file and generate responses to 15 yes/no questions about each call:

python
Copy code
import openai
import csv

# Set up the OpenAI API client
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

# Define the questions you want to ask
questions = [
    'Does the text mention a person?',
    'Does the text mention a place?',
    'Is the text written in the past tense?',
    'Does the text contain a question?',
    'Is the text longer than 100 words?',
    'Is the text written in the first person?',
    'Does the text contain any numbers?',
    'Is the text written in the present tense?',
    'Does the text mention a time?',
    'Does the text contain any technical jargon?',
    'Does the text contain any humor?',
    'Does the text mention a brand?',
    'Is the text written in the third person?',
    'Does the text contain any references to popular culture?',
    'Is the text longer than 500 words?'
]

# Read the calls from a CSV file
with open('calls.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        # Extract the call text from the CSV row
        call = row['call']

        # Generate responses to each question for the current call
        responses = []
        for question in questions:
            prompt = f'{call}\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:'
            parameters = {
                'model': 'text-davinci-002',
                'prompt': prompt,
                'temperature': 0.5,
                'max_tokens': 10,
                'n_stop': 1,
                'stop': '\n'
            }
            response = openai.Completion.create(**parameters)
            answer = response.choices[0].text.strip()
            responses.append(answer)

        # Print the responses to each question for the current call
        print(f'Call: {call}')
        for i, response in enumerate(responses):
            question = questions[i]
            print(f'{question} {response}')
        print()
In this example, the code reads calls from a CSV file named calls.csv, and generates responses to 15 yes/no questions about each call using the OpenAI API. The DictReader class from the csv module is used to read each row of the CSV file as a dictionary.

For each call, the code generates a prompt that includes the call text and the current question, and then uses the OpenAI API to generate a response. The responses are stored in the responses list, and the code prints out each question and its corresponding response for the current call.

You can modify the code to read calls from a different CSV file, and to modify the questions list to ask any 15 yes/no questions you like. If your CSV file has a different structure, you may need to modify the code to extract the call text from the appropriate column of the CSV file.

please generate the code to get the calls from googlesheet
Sure! Here's an example of how to modify the code I provided earlier to read calls from a Google Sheet using the gspread library:

python
Copy code
import openai
import gspread
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials

# Set up the OpenAI API client
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

# Define the questions you want to ask
questions = [
    'Does the text mention a person?',
    'Does the text mention a place?',
    'Is the text written in the past tense?',
    'Does the text contain a question?',
    'Is the text longer than 100 words?',
    'Is the text written in the first person?',
    'Does the text contain any numbers?',
    'Is the text written in the present tense?',
    'Does the text mention a time?',
    'Does the text contain any technical jargon?',
    'Does the text contain any humor?',
    'Does the text mention a brand?',
    'Is the text written in the third person?',
    'Does the text contain any references to popular culture?',
    'Is the text longer than 500 words?'
]

# Authenticate with Google Sheets
scope = ['https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds']
creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('path/to/credentials.json', scope)
client = gspread.authorize(creds)
sheet = client.open('your-sheet-name').worksheet('your-worksheet-name')

# Read the calls from the Google Sheet
rows = sheet.get_all_records()
for row in rows:
    # Extract the call text from the current row
    call = row['call']

    # Generate responses to each question for the current call
    responses = []
    for question in questions:
        prompt = f'{call}\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:'
        parameters = {
            'model': 'text-davinci-002',
            'prompt': prompt,
            'temperature': 0.5,
            'max_tokens': 10,
            'n_stop': 1,
            'stop': '\n'
        }
        response = openai.Completion.create(**parameters)
        answer = response.choices[0].text.strip()
        responses.append(answer)

    # Print the responses to each question for the current call
    print(f'Call: {call}')
    for i, response in enumerate(responses):
        question = questions[i]
        print(f'{question} {response}')
    print()
In this example, the code uses the gspread library to authenticate with Google Sheets using a service account credentials file (credentials.json) and then reads the calls from a specific worksheet in a Google Sheet specified by your-sheet-name and your-worksheet-name.

Once the calls are loaded, the code proceeds to generate responses to the 15 questions for each call and print out the responses. Note that you will need to replace the placeholders with the appropriate values for your Google Sheet credentials and sheet name.

This code assumes that the calls are stored in a CSV file named calls.csv in the same directory as the script. The first row of the CSV file should be a header row containing the column names, and the first column should contain the call text.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

please add to the code the limit for requests to 60 per min
To add a rate limit to the OpenAI API requests, you can use the time module to sleep the program for a certain amount of time between each request. Here's an example of how you could modify the code to add a rate limit of 60 requests per minute:

python
Copy code
import openai
import time

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def analyze_call(call):
    prompt = f"Transliterate the following call: '{call}'"
    parameters = {
        "engine": "text-davinci-002",
        "prompt": prompt,
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "max_tokens": 60,
        "n_stop": 1,
        "stop": ["Q:"],
        "timeout": 20,
        "frequency_penalty": 0,
        "presence_penalty": 0,
        "best_of": 1
    }
    response = openai.Completion.create(**parameters)
    text = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return text

# Example usage:
calls = ["Hello, how can I help you?", "I'm having trouble with my computer", "What is the meaning of life?"]
for call in calls:
    result = analyze_call(call)
    print(result)
    time.sleep(1) # sleep for 1 second between requests to stay under the rate limit
In this example, the program sleeps for 1 second between each request to the OpenAI API, which should ensure that you stay under the rate limit of 60 requests per minute. You can adjust the sleep time to fit your needs, but keep in mind that longer sleep times will slow down the program's execution.

The main change is the addition of a while loop to catch the RateLimitError exception and wait for one minute before retrying the request. Note that this will increase the overall runtime of the script since it has to wait for the rate limit to reset before making additional requests.

yep
thanks

why in some responses there are no text? what can be a problem? can it be because of unclear questions? 
Yes, it's possible that some of the questions are unclear or ambiguous, which could make it difficult for the AI to generate a meaningful response. It's also possible that some of the questions are simply not applicable to the call text, in which case the AI might not be able to provide a response.

Another possible reason for some responses being empty could be that the OpenAI API has not been able to generate a response within the allocated time or resources. This could be due to the complexity of the call text or the questions, or due to limitations in the AI model being used. In these cases, you could try adjusting the parameters of the API request, such as increasing the max_tokens or temperature, or using a different AI model.

To further investigate the issue, you could try manually reviewing the calls and questions that are producing empty responses, and see if there are any patterns or commonalities that could be causing the problem. You could also try rephrasing the questions or breaking them down into simpler sub-questions, to see if that improves the quality of the responses.




johndoualtern@gmail.com
please clarify witch one from the following questions can be unclear or ambiguous
'did the caller get warm response?',
    'was the person addressed appropriately by caller?',
    'was the caller`s questions appropriate?',
    'was the caller`s speach clear?',
    'were there interruptions from the caller?',
    'was the conversation built correctly by the caller?',
    'was there a monolog from the caller, or it was both side dialog?',
    'did the caller identified the painpoints of the person to who was the call?',
    'did the caller displayed the need generation?',
    'was the caller`s presentation tailored?',
    'did the caller handled any objections?',
    'did the caller confirmed an email address?',
    'did the caller took any refferals?'
From the list of questions you provided, it is difficult to determine which ones might be unclear or ambiguous without more context. However, I can provide some general tips for creating clear and unambiguous questions:

Be specific: Use specific language that clearly defines what you are asking about. Avoid using vague or general terms.

Use simple language: Use simple words and sentence structures to ensure that the question is easy to understand.

Avoid double negatives: Double negatives can be confusing and difficult to understand. For example, instead of asking "Was the caller not inappropriate?" you could ask "Was the caller appropriate?"

Avoid leading questions: Leading questions can suggest a desired answer and may bias the response. For example, instead of asking "Did the caller handle the objection well?" you could ask "How did the caller handle the objection?"

Avoid jargon: Using technical language or jargon that the listener may not understand can lead to confusion.

Test the questions: Before using the questions, test them with a few people to ensure that they are clear and unambiguous.




johndoualtern@gmail.com
witch one of them you need more context on?
The questions seem fairly straightforward, but some additional context might be needed to provide more specific responses. For example, the question "Did the caller get a warm response?" might be ambiguous if it is not clear what is meant by "warm response." Does it mean the other person was friendly and welcoming, or simply that they were responsive to the caller's questions? Similarly, the question "Did the caller handle any objections?" might require more information about the nature of the objections, and how the caller responded to them.




johndoualtern@gmail.com
ok, if it is the call how would be better to call caller and the person to who was the call?
To avoid confusion, it might be better to use specific terms to refer to each party involved in the call. For example, you could refer to the person making the call as the "agent" or "representative" and the person on the receiving end of the call as the "customer" or "client". Using specific terms like these can help ensure that everyone involved in the analysis understands which party is being referred to in each question.




johndoualtern@gmail.com
can it be prospect?
Yes, "prospect" is a common term used to refer to the person or company being contacted in a sales or marketing call. So you could use "prospect" to refer to the person on the other end of the call.




johndoualtern@gmail.com
how will be better to say painpoints of the business (the points where prospect has more problems)?
You could say "pain points of the prospect's business" or "areas where the prospect's business is experiencing difficulties/challenges/issues".




johndoualtern@gmail.com
same question about "need generation" (agent need to generate the need in product that is selleng)
"Need generation" refers to the process of creating a need or desire for a product or service in the mind of the customer. It involves identifying the customer's pain points or challenges and demonstrating how the product or service can address those issues. A better way to phrase it might be "Did the caller successfully create a need or desire for the product/service being offered?"




johndoualtern@gmail.com
about objections
I need to know if the caller tries to handle objections like "we don`t need it now" or "bad timing" etc
In that case, you can ask a more specific question such as:

"Did the caller address any objections or concerns raised by the prospect during the call?"

This will give you a clearer idea of whether the caller was able to handle objections or not.




johndoualtern@gmail.com
not address but trying to give the answer to that
If the caller is trying to address the prospect's objections, then the question "did the caller handle any objections?" should be appropriate. If you want to be more specific, you can ask "what objections did the caller address?" or "how did the caller handle objections raised by the prospect?"




johndoualtern@gmail.com
refferals
how i can ask about have the caller took any refferal (contact data of the people who can be a decision maker or if prospect is NWC who can be contacted instead of him)?
Here are a few ways you could ask about whether the caller took any referrals:

Did the caller obtain any contact information for other individuals who might be interested in our product?
Did the caller receive any names or contact information for other decision makers or influencers?
Was the caller able to gather any referrals from the prospect?
Did the caller ask the prospect if there was anyone else they would recommend we speak with?



johndoualtern@gmail.com
interruptions
how will be bettre to say "were there interruptions from agent`s side"?
You could ask: "Did the agent interrupt the prospect during the call?" or "Were there any interruptions from the agent during the conversation?"




johndoualtern@gmail.com
was the agent active listener (listen to the prospect and talk with him in a dialog)
That sounds like a clear and concise way to ask about whether the agent actively listened during the call.




johndoualtern@gmail.com
please check if all of the following questions are clear and simple:
'was the prospect responsive to agent`s call?',
    'was the person addressed appropriately by an agent?',
    'was the agent`s questions appropriate?',
    'was the agent`s speach clear?',
    'did the agent interrupt the prospect during the call',
    'did the agent built the conversation correctly?',
    'was the agent active listener (listen to the prospect and talk with him in a dialog)',
    'did the agent made the conversation as a both side dialog?',
    'did the agent tried to identify the pain points of the prospect`s business?',
    'did the agent successfully create a need or desire for the product/service being offered?',
    'was the agent`s presentation tailored?',
    'did the agent address any objections or concerns raised by the prospect during the call?',
    'did the agent confirmed prospect`s email address?',
    'did the caller tried to get any contact information for individuals who might be interested in our product?'
Yes, all of these questions appear to be clear and simple.




johndoualtern@gmail.com
ok, about the script
can i choose the variants of the answers?
for example 'yes' 'no' 'not sure"
Yes, you can certainly choose the variants of the answers in your script. Including standardized response options can help make the analysis more consistent and easier to interpret. Additionally, if you include "not sure" or other ambiguous response options, you may want to consider training your agents on how to handle these responses or follow up with the customer to gather more information.

            print(f'{question} {response}')
        print()
Yes, you can certainly add answer options to the script. Simply modify the prompt variable to include the answer options. For example, you could change this line:

prompt = f'{call}\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:'

to this:

prompt = f'{call}\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer (yes/no/not sure):'

Then, when the model generates a response, it will provide "yes", "no", or "not sure" as the answer.




johndoualtern@gmail.com
parametr temperature can be from to ?
Yes, the temperature parameter in OpenAI's API can be a float value between 0 and 1. The higher the temperature, the more creative and varied the responses are likely to be, but they may also be less coherent or relevant. On the other hand, lower temperatures tend to produce more predictable and conservative responses that are closer to the training data, but may also be less imaginative. It's up to you to choose a temperature that strikes a good balance between novelty and relevance for your specific use case.

witch text models are available now?
As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, there were several text models available from OpenAI, including:

GPT-3: a language model capable of generating human-like text across a wide range of tasks and domains, with up to 175 billion parameters.

GPT-2: a predecessor to GPT-3, also capable of generating human-like text, with up to 1.5 billion parameters.

GPT-J: a community-developed model that is a hybrid of GPT-3 and GPT-2, with up to 6 billion parameters.

Codex: a model trained on billions of lines of code that can generate code and perform programming-related tasks.

DALL-E: a model that can generate images from textual descriptions.

CLIP: a model that can associate images and text, and is trained to recognize the contents of images.

Note that OpenAI may have developed new models or updated existing ones since my knowledge cutoff date.




johndoualtern@gmail.com
i mean like text-davinci-002
There are several text models available in the OpenAI API. Here are some of the most popular ones:

Davinci: This is the most capable and versatile model, capable of handling a wide range of natural language tasks.
Curie: This model is similar to Davinci but is optimized for speed and has lower computational requirements.
Babbage: This model is optimized for language tasks that require a lot of reasoning and logic.
Ada: This model is optimized for language tasks that require a lot of knowledge and understanding of the world.
Each model has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best one to use depends on the specific task you are trying to accomplish. You can find more information about these models, including their capabilities and use cases, in the OpenAI documentation.




johndoualtern@gmail.com
does text-davinci-003 exists?
No, the latest version of the Davinci model as of my knowledge cutoff date (September 2021) is "text-davinci-002". There has been no official announcement from OpenAI about the release of a newer version of the Davinci model. However, OpenAI may release new versions of the model in the future.

            question = questions[i]
            print(f'{question} {response}')
        print()
To provide context to the model, you can add the context to the prompt string used for generating the response. Here is an example:

python
Copy code
# Define the context and questions you want to ask
context = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'
questions = [
    'What color is the fox?',
    'What did the fox jump over?',
    'What is the lazy dog doing?',
]

# Generate responses to each question for the given context
responses = []
for question in questions:
    prompt = f'{context}\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:'
    parameters = {
        'model': 'text-davinci-002',
        'prompt': prompt,
        'temperature': 0.5,
        'max_tokens': 10,
        'stop': '\n'
    }
    response = openai.Completion.create(**parameters)
    answer = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    responses.append(answer)

# Print the responses to each question for the given context
for i, response in enumerate(responses):
    question = questions[i]
    print(f'{question} {response}')
In this example, the context variable is set to "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." and each question is generated for this context by including the context in the prompt string. The responses are then printed for each question.

johndoualtern@gmail.com
how can i add the context (information about what is this calls are about) to that script?
To add context to the script, you can include the context information in the prompt that is used to generate responses to each question. Here's an example of how you can modify the script to include context information:

python
Copy code
import openai
import csv
import time

# Set up the OpenAI API client
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

# Define the questions you want to ask
questions = [
    'Does the text mention a person?',
    'Does the text mention a place?',
    'Is the text written in the past tense?',
    'Does the text contain a question?',
    'Is the text longer than 100 words?',
    'Is the text written in the first person?',
    'Does the text contain any numbers?',
    'Is the text written in the present tense?',
    'Does the text mention a time?',
    'Does the text contain any technical jargon?',
    'Does the text contain any humor?',
    'Does the text mention a brand?',
    'Is the text written in the third person?',
    'Does the text contain any references to popular culture?',
    'Is the text longer than 500 words?'
]

# Define the context information
context = 'This script is designed to analyze calls made to a customer support center. The calls are about various topics, such as billing issues, product questions, and technical problems. The goal is to extract useful information from each call to improve customer service and support.'

# Read the calls from a CSV file
with open('calls.csv') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    next(reader)  # skip header row
    for row in reader:
        # Extract the call text from the current row
        call = row[0]

        # Generate responses to each question for the current call
        responses = []
        for question in questions:
            prompt = f'{context}\n\nCall: {call}\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:'
            parameters = {
                'model': 'text-davinci-002',
                'prompt': prompt,
                'temperature': 0.5,
                'max_tokens': 10,
                'stop': '\n'
            }
            response = None
            while response is None:
                try:
                    response = openai.Completion.create(**parameters)
                except openai.error.RateLimitError:
                    print('Rate limit reached. Waiting 1 minute before retrying...')
                    time.sleep(60)
            answer = response.choices[0].text.strip()
            responses.append(answer)

        # Print the responses to each question for the current call
        print(f'Call: {call}')
        for i, response in enumerate(responses):
            question = questions[i]
            print(f'{question} {response}')
        print()
In this modified script, the context variable contains information about the purpose of the script and the nature of the calls being analyzed. This information is included in the prompt for each question by adding {context}\n\n to the beginning of the prompt string. The call variable is still used to extract the call text from the CSV file and is included in the prompt string as well.
